A project for my databases class in which I developed a fake social media platform with the goal of implementing 
a personally designed database schema. The application allows users to upload photos, tag individuals and share it 
with a specific group of friends. It also allows users to follow one another and create specific friend groups to share
certain photos with only that group.
